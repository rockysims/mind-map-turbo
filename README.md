This is the start of a project meant to provide a way of constructing a mind map / knowledge web. The goal is to make it so low friction that it can be used in real time during a conversation by multiple people at once and to be able to visualize the full mind map even if it becomes huge by resizing/rearranging the nodes around a primary node (which user can change).

To run the app:
turbo run dev
